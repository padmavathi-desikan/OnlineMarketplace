## Project Intro

Our project describes a online marketplace that will be represent by 5 overarching smart contracts:

* `Admin`
* `StoreOwner`
* `StoreFront`
* `Owner`
* `Pausable`
* `StoreOwnerFactory`

The other elements of the system are represented by externally owned accounts:

* owner of `StoreOwner`
* owner of `StoreFronts`

## Smart contracts

### Admin

  An admin manages store owners.Two main functionality of admin is adding new approved store owners or removing existing store owners.The Admin contract also includes functionality to add a new Admin or remove an existing Admin.

  The state variables used in Admin contract include:

  * `admins` - a mapping between admin addresses to a boolean value that indicates whether the admin is Added(Active) or Removed(Inactive). 

  * `storeowners` - a mapping between storeowner addresses to a boolean value that indicates whether the storeowner is Added(Active) or Removed(Inactive).

   * `storeownercontracts` - a mapping between storeowner addresses to their contract address where the store owner contract has been deployed.

The modifiers in Admin contract include:

* `isAdmin` - is used to validate if a given account is an Admin account to add or remove admins as well as add or remove storeowners.

* `isValidAdmin` - is used to validate if the Admin account already exists.This modifier is used while removing an Admin.

* `isNotAdminYet` - is used to validate if the Admin account does not exists or is Inactive. This modifier is used while adding new Admin or reactivate an Admin.

* `isValidStoreOwner` - is used to validate if the Store Owner account already exists.This modifier is used while removing a Store Owner.

A store owner manages storefronts.Two main functionality of store front is adding new approved store fronts or removing existing store fronts. The store owner can also view all store fronts he has created so far.

The state variables used in Store Owner contract include:

  * `storefronts` - a mapping between store front addresses to a boolean value that indicates whether the store front is Added(Active) or Removed(Inactive). 

The modifiers in Store Owner contract include:

* `isValidStoreFront` - is used to validate if the Store Front already exists.This modifier is used while removing a Store Front or making it inactive.

The events in Store Owner contract include:

* a modifier named `fromOwner` that rolls back the transaction if the transaction sender is not the owner.
* a modifer `isValidAddress` to check if input address from user is not zero.
* a function `setOwner` that ensures the new owner is a valid address and not the current owner itself and changes the owner.
* a constant function `getOwner` that returns the value of the current owner of the contract
* An event `LogOwnerSet` is logged when the owner is being set or modified to new owner.

### `Pausable`

It has a boolean variable `paused` and

* a modifier named `whenPaused` that rolls back the transaction if the contract is in the `false` paused state.
* a modifier named `whenNotPaused` that rolls back the transaction if the contract is in the `true` paused state
* a constructor that takes in no parameter and initial state is not paused.

* a function `setPaused` that pauses the contract
* An event `LogPausedSet` is logged when the paused variable is reset.

### `StoreOwnerFactory`

* a state variable `storeownercontracts` that is a array containing list of all storeowner contracts.
* a function `newStoreOwner` to add new store owner contract.
* a function `getSOContractCount` to get the store owner array length.

## How to Test From UI

* When the UI is up and running, the index page would identify the user logging in and navigate them to their respective page. Remember to have your ganache-cli running at backend, and log into metamask from browser using wallet seed given by ganache-cli before running the command `npm run dev`.
* If you have logged in as a Admin, you will be able to add StoreOwner. Copy an account address(eg Account 2) from Metamask and set it as a Store Owner.
* If you have logged in as a StoreOwner, you will be able to add store fronts. Using See All Stores button , you would be able to navigate into any added storefront. 
  * Inside storefront page store owner will be able to add products or remove products from a store front.
  * The store owner would also be able to modify price of products.
  * Store Owner can withdraw balance from the store front.
* If you have logged in as a Shopper, you will be able to view all Store Fronts and navigate to a specific store front and buy Products. 
* A small note , wait till the metamask shows `browsersynched : connected` or console shows `InstanceGot` comment for all functions to work correctly. Also kindly wait for the `Confirmed transaction notification` in a seperate dialog box from metamask to ensure that updates in UI are reflected correctly.
